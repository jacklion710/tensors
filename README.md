# Tensors

A study of multi dimensional arrays in PyTorch. Also known as tensors, PyTorch allows for GPU acceleration on tensors.

## Why?

As a practitioner of deep learning I have made it my goal to round out my foundational knowledge of AI concepts by following the book <i>Deep Learning with PyTorch, Second Edition</i> to revisit concepts I studied in graduate school. The goal is to be able to understand code written with PyTorch and to be able to architect new models.
